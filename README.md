# Module1-Projects
 This is a module featuring ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
## ApplePicker
 A simple mouse-controlled game where you pick up apples with your baskets. Don't let them fall though, or you lose baskets over time!
## Mission Demolition
 Destroy castles with a slingshot and projectiles. Nothing stands a chance against brute force, but aiming better always helps!
## Pill Time (Prototype 1)
 Wobble around as an agile pill, climbing up a tower to avoid the slowly rising lava. Be careful not to get too close!

# Prototype Goals
The main goal for this game was to have a character climb up a tall tower for as long as possible while a death plane chased after them from below. This concept is similar to a mobile game called "Doodle Jump" which had a similar premise of continuously hopping on platforms to gain height. There are currently a few different components that have been implemented, including:

- Music and sounds (Original stuff for this prototype)
- Fonts (Also original, but used in prior projects)
- A Score and Highscore System (ApplePicker)
- Image textures (Mission Demolition)
- Player movement (Roll-a-ball)
- Rotation scripts (Roll-a-ball)
- Triggers and Collisions (Multiple)
- Follow Cam (Mission Demolition)
- And More!

I wanted to combine quite a few different assets between all the games worked on previously for this course as I wished to use items that would make the experience fun and enjoyable. I had some difficulties with certain parts of the game, with the key feature I look to implement being a randomized stage order for the rooms (currently it is a finite tower but I hope to make it infinite with prefabs). Enjoy messing around with the prototype in its current state as it has taken me quite a lot of restraint to keep playing it myself!
